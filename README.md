# Java-Project-Geometric-Forms-POO-
Study Project in 2 year of CS degree University of Nantes

<h2> Description </h2>
This code allows to move geometric objects in a graphic window (JFrame library) according to trajectories 
which defines like a sequence of points. Using practices of POO to manipulate the objects. User can create new forms 
and trajectories without any change of previous code. For this example was created rectangle, cercle, ellipse which we can move on
horizontal/vertical line, a circle or spiral of Archimedes.

<h2> Entry Point </h2>
The main program is: [AppliDessin.java](AppliDessin.java)
